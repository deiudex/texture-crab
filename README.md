# texture-crab [![Rust](https://github.com/deiudex/texture-crab/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/deiudex/texture-crab/actions/workflows/rust.yml)
WIP fun texture tool. My formal introduction to Rust.

If you want to play around with the code and not a release:
* Please install CMake.
* Please install xorg-dev for Linux (X11) support.
* Please install MINGW, GCC, G++, for rust-c coupling on Windows.
